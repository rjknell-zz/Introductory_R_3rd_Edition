## 3rd Edition draft

This is a draft copy of the third edition of this book. As such it's not yet complete and is still having things added to it or revised. 

## Why this book?

 This book has slowly arisen from a set of course notes that I originally wrote for the postgraduate course, and has since been field-tested on the undergraduates. I decided to self-publish it as an e-book for several reasons. Firstly, it’s an interesting experiment. Secondly, it keeps the price down to roughly 20% of the cost of a book published in the traditional sense. Thirdly, it leaves me with complete control over the content of the book, where it’s available and what’s included in it.

This book is written from the perspective of a biologist, and many of the examples given are either biological or medical ones. The basic principles of the analyses presented are universal, however, and I’ve made an effort to explain the examples in such a way that I hope most people will understand them. Nonetheless, if you’re more used to data from other fields then you might have some difficulty following some of the examples, in which case I’m sorry. Please drop me a line (r.knell@qmul.ac.uk) and let me know if you think one or more of the examples used are particularly opaque and I’ll try to take your feedback into account.

## Acknowledgements

I’d just like to thank all the staff and students at QMUL who gave feedback on the various drafts of the manuscript, especially Mark Stevenson who took a lot of time to check through the code for a previous version, Robin Wyatt who helped with the conversion of the previous version to the new format and Richard Nichols for ruthlessly weeding out any wording that might possibly be interpreted as implying that rejecting a null hypothesis might mean that the alternative hypothesis is true.

## How to use this book

The structure of the book is, I hope, fairly self-evident. The first part  introduces and explains some of the fundamental concepts of R (e.g. basic use of the console, importing data, record Keeping, graphics). Some of these have sets of exercises associated with them (e.g. the "Basics" chapter), some don't but have lots of examples instead. The second part deals with graphics in R, with detailed coverage of base R graphics in two chapters and a third chapter on ggplot2, which is a very popular package offering a very different approach to data visualisation in R. Part 3 is about statistics and how to analyse data in R. We start with basic concepts and go through a series of analyses from chi-squared tests to general linear model fitting. All of these are illustrated with examples using real data sets and the way to carry out these analyses in R is explained in detail, as is how to interpret the output - the latter is often more complicated than the former. Finally, part 4 (pending...) is about more advanced R topics including some "tidyverse" material such as the dplyr package. Once again some of these have exercises associated with them which you might want to work through.

Some of the statistics chapters use reasonably big data sets and these can be downloaded from the [book’s github repository](https://github.com/rjknell/Introductory_R_3rd_Edition) where they are all in the "Data" folder. The data used for the examples is a mix of data from classic studies, data from recent surveys acquired from the government, data from my own research and data that’s been extracted from publications or made available publicly by the authors of recent publications. I’d just like to take this opportunity to point out the fabulous resource that is the Dryad digital repository (http://datadryad.org) and encourage anyone who reads this to upload data from their publications to it. I’ve made an effort to use real data as much as possible for the examples in this book. This means that you should see analyses worked out on warts-and-all data, with the kinds of problems and uncertainties that arise when we’re dealing with data from real research. Some books will show you examples based on the analysis of made-up data which behaves perfectly. I do this to some extent but I try to avoid the danger of giving a false impression of the realities of data analysis: I think it's important to understand that it’s rare to end up with a set of results that behaves nicely and plays properly with your analysis in every way.
